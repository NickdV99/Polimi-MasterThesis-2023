Well, I'm not a famous film star, but I do work for a film studio, and I do meet famous actors every day. I'm a Foley artist--I make the sounds that are added to films after they have been filmed.\n","Why does this need to be done? Well, if actors are filming a fight scene, you can't expect them to really hit each other or break each other's bones, so Foley artists have to find suitable sound. If you come into my studio and find me throwing wet towels   at the wall and breaking carrots in half, don't worry. I'm just recording a fight scene.\n","When my kids were little, they loved our Christmas films because we always needed to record the sound of children walking on snow. It doesn't often snow in California, so I had to create the sound in the studio. I used to cover part of studio floor with salt crystals   and pour thick flour   over the top. Then I brought my kids and their friends to the studio so that I could record them walking in the \"snow\". After the recording, they never wanted to leave; they stayed and played, they got \"snow\" in their shoes, on their clothes, even in their hair!\n","These days studios use computers to create such common sounds as footsteps on snow. Some Foley artists see computers as a threat   but I welcome the new technology. A lot of \"everyday\" sounds used to take a whole day to create, so there was a lot of pressure   to get everything done on time. With computers, there's a lot less stress and I can devote more of my time to creating unusual sound effects. As long as people keep coming up with new ideas for films, studios will need Foley artists to come up with the sounds for them. - Question: The writer's job is to  _  .\n","\n","\n","Iteration 44 - Context: You've probably heard of working dogs that help police officers, or horses that help farmers.

Gossip is hearing something we like about someone we don't and,in nearly every country in the world,gossip magazines have huge numbers of readers.According to researchers,however,this kind of gossip also has a good side because it helps us put our own problems in perspective .\"If we read bad news about well-known people,or get the frightful details of our neighbors' bad situation over a cup of coffee,our own problems begin to pale in comparison ,\"says Dr.Jack Levin of Northeastern University.\n","However,that doesn't mean that gossip is necessarily a good thing,either.Researchers found that people who gossip a lot tend to feel like they're under a lot of stress.This might be because while they're busy talking about other people,they're also busy thinking what other people are saying about them. - Question: According to the passage,people in general think that  _  .\n","\n","\n","Iteration 47 - Context: If you don't keep yourself warm enough, winter can be a time of illness.\n","During the winter months, people easily get colds and flu  .

The inside of the bigger one is my knowledge of things, and the inside of the smaller one is yours. Out of the circles is what is still unknown to us.

Therefore, the correct option is \"A TV\", which is mentioned earlier in the conversation.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 38:\n","{'cop': \"C.

This is mentioned in the context: \"and the happiest person is the one who enjoys what each age gives him without wasting his time in useless regrets.\"\n","\n","Furthermore, the passage states that when a young man starts to earn his own living and no longer expects others to pay for him, he can have the greatest happiness of building up his own position in society. This implies that a grown-up who is independent and responsible for his own well-being is considered the happiest person in the passage.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 39:\n","{'cop': 'reporter', 'cop index': 'D'}\n","\n","The correct answer is D. reporter.\n","\n","This can be inferred from the phrase \"writes the passage.\" A reporter is responsible for writing and reporting news articles or stories.

A pigeon carried the camera to take photos of the enemy land.\n","\n","This statement is true because the passage mentions that during wars, carrier pigeons were used with small cameras tied to their feet. As they flew over enemy land, the camera took photos of the land below, allowing soldiers to gather information about the enemy's whereabouts and activities.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 45:\n","{'cop': 'D', 'cop index': 'D'}\n","\n","According to the writer, fast food is becoming more and more popular in the world.
