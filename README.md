# Prompt Engineering and Response Evaluation: Unveil the Dynamics of Large Language Models

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral components in various applications, ranging from natural language understanding to content generation. As their significance grows, so does the need to scrutinize and evaluate their responses due to potential risks such as private data leaks and the generation of inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content.

This masterâ€™s thesis delves into the assessment of Large Language Models responses, introducing key metrics such as correctness, coherence, relevance, and completeness. Recognizing that the quality of responses is intricately linked to the nature of the questions posed to Large Language Models, we explore the concept of prompt engineering as a crucial factor influencing response quality.

To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we utilize multi-domain datasets as well as domain-specific ones, encompassing both open-answer and multiple-choice formats, in order to ensure an unbiased and generalized evaluation. Our analysis reveals intriguing findings, demonstrating that the effectiveness of prompt engineering is not universal. While in certain cases, optimizing prompts enhances response quality, in others, it introduces unnecessary complexity, leading to inferior results.

## Statement of the Problem

In the ever-evolving landscape of computer engineering, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in a new era, where these sophisticated models play a pivotal role in a myriad of applications. From unraveling the nuances of natural language to generating content with remarkable finesse, LLMs have become integral components across various domains. Their significance is underscored by their omnipresence in tasks ranging from language understanding to content creation. As these models permeate deeper into our technological fabric, the imperative to scrutinize and evaluate their responses becomes increasingly pronounced.

The crux of our research lies in acknowledging the inherent challenges that accompany the deployment of LLMs. The exponential growth in their utility brings forth potential risks, such as private data leaks and the inadvertent generation of inappropriate, harmful, or misleading content. This necessitates a comprehensive investigation into the quality of responses produced by LLMs, laying the foundation for our exploration into the intricate interplay between these models and the questions posed to them.
