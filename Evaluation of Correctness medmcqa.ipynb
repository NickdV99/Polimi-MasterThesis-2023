Small intestinal obstruction refers to a blockage that prevents the passage of food, liquids, and gas through the small intestine. As the blockage persists, the bowel becomes distended with trapped contents, leading to the characteristic abdominal distension. This is often accompanied by discomfort or colicky abdominal pain due to increased peristalsis in an attempt to push the obstruction along. Fever can sometimes be present if there is an associated infection, but it is not a primary feature. High peristalsis with colic is a common symptom but not the primary feature. The empty rectum is not specific to small intestinal obstruction and can be seen in other conditions as well.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 3:\n","{\n","\"cop\": \"One duct is completely absent\",\n","\"cop index\": \"2\"\n","} \n","\n","Explanation: The correct option is \"One duct is completely absent\". A unicornuate uterus is a type of uterine anomaly where one of the two mullerian ducts fails to develop or is completely absent. This results in a single uterus with only one fallopian tube. The other options are not correct because a unicornuate uterus is not a defect in the fusion of mullerian ducts, as both ducts are present but one is underdeveloped or absent. Additionally, a unicornuate uterus does not have two fallopian tubes, as only one tube is present.

Hemophilia A is typically diagnosed with significantly lower levels of factor VIII.\n","\n","Option e) is incorrect because bleeding time is usually normal in hemophilia A.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 5:\n","{\"cop\": \"Responds well to monoclonal antibodies\", \"cop index\": \"2\"}\n","\n","Explanation: \n","\n","HER2/neu overexpression in breast cancer is associated with a more aggressive tumor biology and poorer prognosis. It is not true that HER2/neu overexpression is associated with a good prognosis. \n","\n","Taxanes are a class of chemotherapy drugs that are commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. While HER2/neu overexpression can affect response to chemotherapy, there is no specific evidence to suggest that it responds well to taxanes. Therefore, the statement that HER2/neu overexpression responds well to taxanes is not true.\n","\n","Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin), are targeted therapies that specifically target HER2/neu overexpression. These antibodies have been shown to be effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancer. Therefore, the statement that HER2/neu overexpression responds well to monoclonal antibodies is true.\n","\n","HER2/neu overexpression is not seen exclusively in breast cancer. It can also be seen in other types of cancer, such as gastric cancer.

This incision allows access to the gallbladder for procedures such as cholecystectomy.\n","\n","The other options listed are not muscle splitting incisions:\n","\n","1. Rutherford-Morris: This is not a muscle splitting incision. It is a transverse incision made in the lower abdomen for procedures such as cesarean section or pelvic surgery.\n","\n","2. Pfannensteil: This is also not a muscle splitting incision. It is a transverse incision made above the pubic bone for procedures such as pelvic surgery or hysterectomy.\n","\n","3. Lanz: Lanz incision is not a muscle splitting incision.

Memantine is not a cholinergic drug. It works by blocking the NMDA receptors in the brain and is used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. \n","\n","The other options, Tacrine, Rivastigmine, and Donepezil, are all cholinergic drugs. They work by increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve memory and cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n","\n","Therefore, Memantine is the correct answer as it does not belong to the cholinergic drug class.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 8:\n","{\n","  \"cop\": \"Hyperparathyroidism\",\n","  \"cop index\": \"3\"\n","}\n","\n","Explanation: The punched out appearance in the skull is commonly seen in a condition called hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is caused by overactive parathyroid glands, which leads to excessive release of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This hormone is responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body. When there is an excess of PTH, it causes increased bone resorption, resulting in the characteristic punched out lesions in the skull.\n","\n","Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. It can cause bone lesions, but they are typically described as lytic lesions rather than punched out.\n","\n","Thalassemia is a blood disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin. It can lead to bone marrow expansion, but punched out skull lesions are not a characteristic feature of thalassemia.\n","\n","Carcinoma lung, or lung cancer, can metastasize to the bone and cause bone lesions, but punched out skull lesions are not specific to lung cancer and can be seen in other conditions like multiple myeloma or hyperparathyroidism.\n","\n","Therefore, the correct option is hyperparathyroidism.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 9:\n","{ 'cop': 'Measles', 'cop index': 0}\n","\n","Explanation: Antibodies to Measles infection are not transmitted to the child. Measles is a highly contagious viral infection that spreads through respiratory droplets. When a person becomes infected with the measles virus, their immune system produces antibodies to fight against the infection. These antibodies help in clearing the virus from the body and provide immunity against future infections. However, these antibodies are not passed on from the mother to the child during pregnancy, unlike antibodies for other infections such as Peusis, Diphtheria, and Polio.\n","\n","- Peusis: Antibodies to Peusis infection can be transmitted from the mother to the child during pregnancy. Peusis is caused by a bacterium called Treponema pallidum, and when a pregnant woman is infected with syphilis, antibodies can cross the placenta and provide some protection to the fetus.\n","\n","- Diphtheria: Antibodies to Diphtheria infection can be transmitted from the mother to the child during pregnancy. Diphtheria is caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and maternal antibodies against diphtheria can be transferred to the baby via the placenta, providing some immunity in early infancy.\n","\n","- Polio: Antibodies to Polio infection can be transmitted from the mother to the child during pregnancy. Polio is caused by the poliovirus, and maternal antibodies against polio can be transferred to the baby via the placenta, providing some protection in the early stages of life.\n","\n","Therefore, the correct option is Measles, as antibodies to Measles infection are not transmitted to the child.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 10:\n","{\"cop\": \"The absence of air-fluid levels on plain supine radiographs does not rule out presence of an obstruction.\", \"cop index\": \"3\"} \n","\n","The correct option is: The absence of air-fluid levels on plain supine radiographs does not rule out presence of an obstruction. \n","\n","Explanation: Intestinal obstruction can be diagnosed through radiological features, but the absence of air-fluid levels on plain supine radiographs does not definitively rule out the presence of an obstruction. Intestinal obstruction can sometimes be incomplete or partial, and in such cases, air and fluid may not accumulate proximal to the site of obstruction, leading to a lack of visible air-fluid levels on imaging. Therefore, the absence of air-fluid levels on plain supine radiographs does not exclude the possibility of an obstruction. \n","\n","The other options are not correct for the following reasons:\n","\n","1. The small intestines are said to be dilated if the loops of bowel have a diameter > 3cm: This statement is true. Dilated small intestines are a common radiological finding in cases of intestinal obstruction. \n","2. The large bowel is said to be dilated if it is >5 cm for the distal bowel and >9 cm for the proximal bowel: This statement is true. Dilated large bowel loops are also a common radiological finding in cases of colonic obstruction. \n","3. Volvulus and mesenteric ischemia have characteristic signs on abdominal films: This statement is true. Both volvulus (twisting of the bowel) and mesenteric ischemia (inadequate blood supply to the intestines) can have characteristic radiological features, such as a \"whirl sign\" for volvulus and signs of bowel wall ischemia for mesenteric ischemia.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 11:\n","{\n","  \"cop\": \"Lower 1/3rd endocervix\",\n","  \"cop index\": \"1\"\n","}\n","\n","Explanation:\n","In colposcopy, the lower 1/3rd endocervix is not visualized. Colposcopy is a procedure that allows for a closer examination of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, using a magnifying instrument called a colposcope. During colposcopy, the upper 2/3rd endocervix, vault of the vagina, and lateral fornix are visualized. However, the lower 1/3rd endocervix is not visible during the procedure. Therefore, the correct answer in this case is \"Lower 1/3rd endocervix\".\n","\n","The other options are incorrect because they are all visualized during colposcopy. The upper 2/3rd endocervix refers to the upper portion of the cervix that can be seen during the procedure. The vault of the vagina, which is the area between the cervix and the front wall of the rectum, is also visualized. Additionally, the lateral fornix, which is the upper portion of the vagina near the cervix, is also examined during colposcopy.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 12:\n","{\"cop\": \"Cochlear nucleus\", \"cop index\": \"2\"}\n","\n","Explanation:\n","Wave V in BERA corresponds to the activity of the cochlear nucleus. BERA, or brainstem auditory evoked response, is a test that evaluates the electrical activity in the auditory pathway from the ear to the brainstem. The waveforms recorded during the test represent the sequential activation of various auditory structures. Wave V specifically represents the activity of the cochlear nucleus, which is the first structure in the auditory pathway where the sound signals are processed. It receives input from the eighth nerve (option D) and sends it to the superior olivary complex in the brainstem. The inferior colliculus (option A) and lateral lemniscus (option B) are further along in the auditory pathway and are not directly associated with Wave V.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 13:\n","{\n","  \"cop\": \"Aneurysmal cyst\",\n","  \"cop index\": \"2\"\n","}\n","\n","Explanation:\n","\n","Among the given options, the presence of cholesterol crystals is typically seen in aneurysmal cysts. Aneurysmal cysts are benign lesions that can occur in various parts of the body, including bones and soft tissues. They are often filled with a thick, yellow fluid that contains cholesterol crystals. These crystals can be visualized microscopically and are characteristic of aneurysmal cysts.\n","\n","Keratocyst, periodontal cyst, and hemorrhagic cyst do not typically show the presence of cholesterol crystals. Keratocysts are derived from the lining of the jawbone and usually contain keratinized material rather than cholesterol crystals. Periodontal cysts are typically filled with a clear or straw-colored fluid and do not contain cholesterol crystals. Hemorrhagic cysts are cystic lesions that contain blood or blood products but do not typically contain cholesterol crystals.\n","\n","Therefore, among the given options, aneurysmal cyst is the most appropriate choice for showing the presence of cholesterol crystals.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 14:\n","{\n","   \"cop\": \"Berry aneurysm rupture\",\n","   \"cop index\": \"0\"\n","} \n","\n","Explanation:\n","The most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage is rupture of a cerebral berry aneurysm. These aneurysms are outpouchings of blood vessels in the brain, and when they rupture, they cause bleeding into the subarachnoid space. This can result in a sudden, severe headache, often described as the worst headache of one's life. Other symptoms may include a stiff neck, vision changes, and loss of consciousness. Berry aneurysms are typically congenital and can be caused by genetic factors, smoking, high blood pressure, and certain connective tissue disorders.\n","\n","The other options provided are not correct:\n","- Post traumatic: While trauma to the head can cause bleeding in the brain, it is not the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Trauma-related subarachnoid hemorrhage is typically seen in cases of significant head injury.\n","- Hypertensive bleed: High blood pressure (hypertension) can lead to bleeding in the brain, but it is not the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Hypertension-related bleeding is more commonly seen in other types of intracranial hemorrhages, such as intracerebral hemorrhage.\n","- Coagulation disorder: Coagulation disorders can predispose individuals to bleeding, but they are not the most common cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Coagulation disorders are more commonly associated with bleeding in other areas of the body, such as nosebleeds or heavy menstrual bleeding. \n","\n","Therefore, the correct option is \"Berry aneurysm rupture\".\n","\n","\n","Risposta 15:\n","{\n","  \"cop\": \"Caries teeth\",\n","  \"cop index\": \"3\"\n","}\n","\n","Explanation:\n","\n","Rickets is a condition that affects bone development in children due to a deficiency in vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It can lead to several characteristic signs and symptoms.\n","\n","Option 3, Caries teeth, is not a sign of active rickets. Rickets primarily affects bone development and can cause skeletal deformities such as bowing of the legs, curvature of the spine, and a characteristic \"hot cross bun\" sign in the brain MRI. It can also present with a prominent fontanelle or soft spot on the infant's skull. Another common manifestation is a saddle nose deformity, where there is a depression in the bridge of the nose.\n","\n","On the other hand, caries teeth refer to tooth decay or cavities, which can occur due to poor dental hygiene, a diet high in sugar, or other factors. While children with rickets may have an increased risk of dental problems, caries teeth are not a specific sign of active rickets.\n","\n","Therefore, the correct option is \"Caries teeth\" (Option 3), and the other options are signs of active rickets.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 16:\n","{ \"cop\": \"Vincristine, Etoposide, Cisplatin\", \"cop index\": \"0\" }\n","\n","Explanation:\n","The correct option is Vincristine, Etoposide, Cisplatin. Retinoblastoma is a type of eye cancer that commonly affects young children. Chemotherapy is one of the treatment options for retinoblastoma. The combination of Vincristine, Etoposide, and Cisplatin is commonly used in chemotherapy protocols for retinoblastoma.\n","\n","Vincristine is a chemotherapy drug that interferes with the growth of cancer cells. It disrupts the microtubule structures within the cells, preventing cell division and ultimately leading to cell death.\n","\n","Etoposide is another chemotherapy drug that works by inhibiting topoisomerase II enzyme, which is involved in DNA replication and repair. By interfering with this enzyme, Etoposide prevents cancer cells from proliferating.\n","\n","Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug that works by causing DNA damage in cancer cells. It forms covalent bonds with DNA strands, leading to the disruption of the double helix structure and inhibition of cell division.\n","\n","The other options are not correct because they do not represent the commonly used chemotherapy regimens for retinoblastoma.\n","\n","Vinblastine, Epirubicin, Cisplatin: Vinblastine is a chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of various cancers, but it is not commonly used in retinoblastoma chemotherapy protocols. Epirubicin, another chemotherapy drug, is primarily used in the treatment of breast cancer and other types of solid tumors, but not retinoblastoma. Therefore, this combination is not the correct option for chemotherapy in retinoblastoma.\n","\n","Vincristine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide: While Vincristine and Etoposide are commonly used in retinoblastoma chemotherapy, Cyclophosphamide is not a part of the standard chemotherapy protocols for retinoblastoma. Cyclophosphamide is used in the treatment of various types of cancers, but not specifically in retinoblastoma.\n","\n","Vinblastine, Etoposide, Cisplatin: This combination is similar to the correct option, but it includes Vinblastine instead of Vincristine. Vincristine is the preferred drug for retinoblastoma treatment, as it has shown better efficacy in this specific type of cancer.\n","\n","Therefore, the correct option for chemotherapy in retinoblastoma is Vincristine, Etoposide, Cisplatin.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 17:\n","{ \"cop\": \"There are no drugs for personal prophylaxis\", \"cop index\": \"3\" } \n","\n","Explanation: The false statement about Leishmaniasis is that there are no drugs for personal prophylaxis. In fact, there are drugs available for personal prophylaxis of Leishmaniasis, such as the antiparasitic drug miltefosine. Personal prophylaxis involves taking medication to prevent infection in individuals who are at high risk, such as travelers to endemic areas or individuals with compromised immune systems. \n","\n","Regarding the other options:\n","- The Aldehyde Test of Napier is not a test for diagnosing Leishmaniasis. Instead, diagnosis is commonly done by microscopic examination of tissue samples, such as a biopsy or an aspirate of skin lesions, to identify the presence of the Leishmania parasite.\n","- Indian Leishmaniasis is indeed a non-zoonotic infection, meaning it is not transmitted between animals and humans. However, the statement that man is the sole reservoir is incorrect. Dogs are the main reservoir for Indian Leishmaniasis, and they play a significant role in transmitting the infection to humans through sand fly bites.\n","- Co-infection with AIDS is a known association with Leishmaniasis. HIV/AIDS can increase the risk and severity of Leishmaniasis, as the immune system impairment makes individuals more susceptible to the infection and increases the likelihood of developing a severe form of the disease.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 18:\n","{\"cop\": \"All of the above\", \"cop index\": \"3\"}\n","\n","\n","Risposta 19:\n","{\n","'cop': 'none of the above',\n","'cop index': 'none'\n","}\n","\n","Explanation: Burning feet syndrome, also known as peripheral neuropathy, is not specifically related to a deficiency of any of the mentioned nutrients (niacin, folic acid, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid).

During embryonic development, the tongue develops from structures derived from the first, second, and third pharyngeal arches.\n","\n","The second branchial cleft (option 1) does not contribute to the development of intrinsic muscles of the tongue. The second branchial cleft gives rise to the cervical sinus, which typically disappears during development.\n","\n","Occipital somites (option 3) are not involved in the development of the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. The occipital somites give rise to muscles in the region of the neck and back, but not specifically to the intrinsic muscles of the tongue.\n","\n","Cervical somites (option 4) also do not contribute to the development of intrinsic muscles of the tongue. Cervical somites give rise to various neck muscles, such as the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, but not the intrinsic muscles of the tongue.\n","\n","Therefore, the correct option is \"Pharyngeal arch mesenchyme\", as this is the source of the mesodermal cells that give rise to the intrinsic muscles of the tongue.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 21:\n","{\n","  \"cop\": \"75 to 98%\",\n","  \"cop index\": \"3\"\n","}\n","\n","Explanation: The normal range of hemoglobin O2 saturation in systemic venous blood is approximately 75 to 85%, while in systemic arterial blood it is approximately 95 to 98%.

The presence of hematemesis (vomiting of blood) along with low blood pressure (90/60 mmHg), tachycardia (heart rate of 120/min), and splenomegaly suggests an upper gastrointestinal bleed. Gastric ulcers are a common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, especially in middle-aged individuals. The low blood pressure and tachycardia are likely due to hypovolemia resulting from the bleeding. Splenomegaly could be secondary to portal hypertension, which can be associated with gastric ulcers.\n","\n","None of the other options are the most probable cause in this case:\n","- Portal hypertension (poal hypeension) can cause bleeding from varices, but the presence of gastric ulcer and splenomegaly make it less likely.\n","- Duodenal ulcers can cause bleeding, but the presence of splenomegaly makes gastric ulcer more likely in this case.\n","- Drug-induced gastrointestinal injury can cause bleeding, but there is no specific information provided to suggest drug-induced injury as the cause in this case.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 23:\n","{\n","\"cop\": \"Hypercalcemia\",\n","\"cop index\": \"2\"\n","} \n","\n","In chronic calcific pancreatitis, three out of the four options are commonly seen, whereas one option is not characteristic of this condition.

The chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreatic tissue can lead to impairment of pancreatic enzyme secretion, including lipase, which is necessary for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats.\n","\n","3. Recurrent abdominal pain: Recurrent abdominal pain is a hallmark symptom of chronic calcific pancreatitis. The inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreas can cause persistent abdominal pain, typically located in the upper abdomen, and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.\n","\n","4. Hypercalcemia: Hypercalcemia, or high levels of calcium in the blood, is not a characteristic finding in chronic calcific pancreatitis. While calcium can form calcifications within the pancreas in this condition, it does not typically lead to an increase in blood calcium levels.\n","\n","Therefore, the option \"Hypercalcemia\" is not seen in chronic calcific pancreatitis, making it the correct answer.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 24:\n","{\"cop\": \"Absence of T cells\", \"cop index\": \"3\"}\n","\n","Explanation:\n","DiGeorge's syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion on chromosome 22.

The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it into the right ventricle before it is sent to the lungs for oxygenation.\n","\n","In summary, the right atrium is not part of the right side of the mediastinal shadow, while the other options (superior vena cava, right innominate, and right ventricle) contribute to the formation of the right side of the mediastinal shadow.\n","\n","\n","Risposta 31:\n","{ 'cop': 'Respiratory distress syndrome', 'cop index': '0' }\n","\n","Explanation:\n","The hyaline membrane in the lung is seen in Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), also known as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease. RDS is a condition that primarily affects premature infants due to an insufficient amount of surfactant in their lungs. The hyaline membrane refers to a thickened layer of proteinaceous material that lines the alveoli and bronchioles. This membrane is composed of dead cells, debris, and fibrin, making it difficult for gas exchange to occur properly. \n","\n","Pulmonary edema is the accumulation of fluid in the lung tissue and alveoli, which can be caused by various factors such as heart failure, kidney disease, or lung infection. It does not typically present with a hyaline membrane.\n","\n","Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of pneumonia caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. The infection leads to inflammation and consolidation of lung tissue, but it does not result in the formation of a hyaline membrane.\n","\n","Acute viral hepatitis is a liver disease caused by certain viruses, such as hepatitis A, B, and C.

This helps to maintain higher levels of calcium in the blood.\n","\n","Calcitriol promotes intestinal absorption of calcium by increasing the expression of calcium-binding proteins and stimulating the synthesis of calcium transport channels in the intestinal cells. This leads to higher absorption of dietary calcium from the intestines into the bloodstream.\n","\n","However, calcitriol does not reduce plasma calcium concentration. In fact, it helps to maintain normal plasma calcium levels by enhancing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys and increasing calcium absorption from the intestines. If plasma calcium concentration falls, calcitriol synthesis is usually stimulated to restore normal levels.\n","\n","The option \"Reduces Ca2+ resorption by bone\" is not correct. Calcitriol actually enhances calcium resorption by bone.
